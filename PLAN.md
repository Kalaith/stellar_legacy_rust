# Stellar Legacy — Framework Handoff Plan

*Written 2026-07-18 after the initial framework build. Read `gdd.md` first — this
document maps the GDD onto what already exists in code and what the next agent
should build, in order.*

## Current status: framework complete, M1 mostly proven

The project is a fully compiling, tested skeleton with the GDD §11 architecture in
place. Verified: `cargo test` (18 tests green), `cargo clippy --all-targets
--all-features -- -D warnings` (clean), `cargo fmt` (applied), WASM target checks
(`cargo check --release --target wasm32-unknown-unknown`), and headless UI captures
for four scenes (`docs/verification/ui_{menu,gameplay,event,dilemma}.png`, regenerate
with `.\scripts\capture_ui.ps1 -Scenes menu,gameplay,event,dilemma`).

A campaign is already playable end-to-end in skeleton form: pick a legacy → accept a
charter → advance years → resolve council events → generations turn over → contract
completes → Chronicle entry recorded and persisted across saves.

## What is implemented (and where)

| System (GDD ref) | Module | State |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Data loading, all `assets/*.json` (§6) | `src/data.rs` + `src/data/*` | **Done** — serde types, embedded via `include_str!`, load-tested |
| Sim state, campaign creation (§5.1) | `src/state/sim.rs` | **Done** — serializable, deterministic per seed, serde round-trip tested |
| Yearly tick (§3, §5.1) | `src/simulation/tick.rs` | **Done** — production, food upkeep, ship wear, generation trigger, contract progress, market drift, event roll; determinism tested over decades |
| Succession (§5.3) | `src/simulation/succession.rs` | **Done** — 25-year aging, retirement at 70, best-heir 30-50 selection, 1-3 births, elder mortality (extension: needed so extinction is reachable), extinction flag |
| Contract scoring (§5.2) | `src/simulation/contract.rs` | **Done** — exact GDD formula + bands, tested; milestone/metric tracking each year |
| Event roll/scoring/resolution (§5.4) | `src/simulation/event_resolver.rs` | **Done** — chance formula (capped), distress-scaled category weights, legacy-weighted template pick, outcome auto-scoring, delegation-aware resolution |
| Market (§5.1) | `src/simulation/market.rs` | **Done** — buy/sell validation, bounded yearly price walk |
| Save/load (§7) | `src/save.rs` | **Done** — toolkit slots, migration hook stubbed for future versions |
| Chronicle (§7) | `src/chronicle.rs` | **Partial** — persistent cross-playthrough contract log works; **Heritage modifiers not started** |
| State machine (§11) | `src/state.rs`, `src/game.rs` | **Done** — Menu/Gameplay, explicit `StateTransition`, `UiAction` dispatch via `EventBus` |
| Terminal UI shell (§9) | `src/ui.rs` + `src/ui/*` | **Done as skeleton** — all 6 screens + blocking event modal, amber/green/red phosphor palette |
| Capture harness | `src/main.rs` (`STELLAR_LEGACY` prefix) | **Done** — scenes: `menu`, `gameplay`, `event` |

## What is NOT built yet (the next agent's work)

Ordered roughly by milestone (GDD §13):

### Finish M1 → M2 (playable prototype)

1. ~~**Legacy dilemmas are loaded but never fire.**~~ **DONE (2026-07-18).**
   Dilemmas roll on generation boundaries (`simulation/legacy.rs::roll_dilemma`,
   wired in `tick.rs`; chance in `game_config.json` →
   `dilemma_chance_per_generation`), always block (never delegated), suppress the
   same year's event roll, and apply `DilemmaEffect` including the legacy counters.
   The §5.5 failure-risk formula lives in `simulation/legacy.rs::failure_risk`
   (thresholds in config → `failure_risk` block; drift/unity threaten all legacies,
   counter terms only their own legacy) and is surfaced with its contributing
   factors on the Crew & Dynasty screen. New capture scene: `dilemma`. Note:
   dilemma content is still 1 per legacy — M3 target is 6 per legacy (§8).
2. ~~**Crew management.**~~ **DONE (2026-07-18).** One post per archetype:
   `SimState.crew` roster, `simulation/crew.rs` (recruit/train verbs, costs in
   config → `crew` block), crew age out on generation boundaries. Skill effects
   are data-driven on `crew_archetypes.json`: `production_per_skill` multipliers
   (applied in the tick), medic `famine_loss_reduction_per_skill`, security-chief
   `unity_recovery_per_skill` (below a config ceiling). `SelectHeir` designates a
   successor stored on `Dynasty.designated_heir`, honored by succession over the
   best-leadership fallback. Crew UI lives on the Crew & Dynasty screen (`crew`
   capture scene). Event-outcome hooks (navigator/combat) intentionally deferred
   to item 3 where ship component stats land.
3. **Production bonuses.** `ProductionRates` is pre-keyed (the GDD §5.1 bug fix),
   but nothing modifies it yet — ship components and contract milestones should
   grant production deltas. The Ship Builder purchase currently only swaps the
   loadout id; make component stats matter (speed → contract progress, cargo →
   market lots, combat → wanderer dilemma odds).
4. **Game-over / retirement flow.** Dynasty extinction sets a flag and blocks
   time; the Chronicle screen should take over with a playthrough summary and a
   "retire voyage" path (GDD §7 progression table).
5. **Event content.** 4 templates exist (original parity). M2 target is 12 across
   the 4 categories (§8). Pure `assets/events.json` work; the resolver needs no
   changes. Use `consequences` (already tracked on the sim) to gate/weight
   follow-up events — that's the intended payoff of Pillar 2.
6. **Contract content**: 2 templates exist; add exploration + rescue (§8: 4 total
   for prototype).

### M3 (content-complete)

7. **Heritage modifiers** (§7): on retirement/extinction, derive small starting
   bonuses from `ChronicleStore` entries for the next campaign; 4 tiers (§8).
8. Content targets from §8: 30+ events, 5/5/5 components, 6-8 contracts, 6 dilemmas
   per legacy, doubled name pools.
9. **Terminal polish**: monospace bitmap font (default font is close but not
   monospace), ~~flicker fx~~ **CRT overlay DONE (2026-07-18)** —
   `macroquad_toolkit::fx::CrtOverlay`/`CrtStyle` (new toolkit module
   `fx/crt.rs`): scanlines + corner vignette + slow rolling refresh band +
   subtle flicker, drawn screen-space at the end of `Game::draw`, amber preset,
   F10 toggle. ~~typewriter text reveal~~ **DONE (2026-07-18)** — toolkit
   `fx/typewriter.rs` (`typed_prefix`/`typed_char_count`/`is_fully_typed`,
   pure + tested); modal body text streams in at `REVEAL_CPS` with a blinking
   underscore cursor (`event_modal::draw_typed_block`). A cosmetic reveal clock
   lives on `Game` (`modal_reveal`, reset per modal, instant in capture).
   ~~power-on boot sequence~~ **DONE (2026-07-18)** — `src/boot.rs`
   (`BootScreen`) streams a terminal POST log once before the menu on launch
   (amber banner + green status lines, blinking cursor, ~2.5s, any input skips);
   frozen-frame `boot` capture scene added. ~~phosphor text glow~~ **DONE
   (2026-07-18)** — toolkit `ui::draw_text_glow` (dim offset copies fanned to a
   radius + crisp foreground) gives bright headings a CRT bloom; applied to the
   menu title, the gameplay header game-name, and the boot banner (subtle
   alphas so body text stays crisp). ~~settings screen (CRT toggle)~~ **DONE
   (2026-07-18)** — F1 opens a `DISPLAY // CRT MONITOR` overlay
   (`src/ui/settings.rs`) with toggles for CRT effect / scanlines / flicker and
   an amber↔green phosphor choice; prefs persist under their own `display`
   key (`src/settings.rs::DisplaySettings`, loaded at startup, saved on change,
   separate from the sim save so determinism is untouched). F10 still hard-
   toggles the effect. New `settings` capture scene. ~~phosphor recolor~~ **DONE
   (2026-07-18)** — the `term` palette is now runtime phosphor-aware: every hue
   is a `fn` reading a thread-local tube (`term::set_phosphor`), so choosing
   GREEN recolors the *entire* monochrome UI (text, borders, panels, surface
   fills), not just the overlay tint; alerts stay warm-red on both tubes. New
   `green` capture scene. ~~`catalog_thumbnail.png`~~ **DONE (2026-07-18)** —
   root 16:9 title capture from the menu scene. ~~screen curvature~~ **DONE
   (2026-07-18)** — `CrtOverlay` now masks rounded tube-glass corners
   (`CrtStyle::corner_radius`/`bezel`, baked corner texture flipped per corner,
   drawn last so the bezel clips every layer); presets ship a 26px radius. UI
   content is inset so nothing clips. **Monospace font DEFERRED** —
   the toolkit font API (`set_default_ui_font_from_bytes`) is ready, but no
   monospace TTF is bundled in the repo (only proportional Rajdhani/DejaVuSans);
   sourcing one is a licensing decision for a human. Still to do: fold
   delegation defaults into the settings overlay, ko-fi/index.html screenshots.
10. Consider `achievements` for Chronicle milestones (GDD §10 "maybe").

## Conventions the framework already follows (keep them)

- **Determinism discipline (§5.6):** all gameplay randomness goes through
  `sim.rng` (`SeededRng`, serialized in the save). Never use `macroquad::rand`
  or toolkit free-function rng in the sim. `DataRegistry` is hash-map backed —
  **sort ids** (`GameData::sorted_ids`) before any RNG-driven or displayed
  iteration (see `event_resolver::roll_event`).
- **UI is a pure view layer:** panels read `&SimState` and push `UiAction`; all
  mutation lives in `game.rs` / `simulation/*`. Add a variant to `UiAction` for
  any new interaction.
- **Data-driven:** balance/content changes belong in `assets/*.json`, not Rust
  constants. Tunables live in `assets/data/game_config.json` → `GameConfig`.
- **Time only moves on `AdvanceYear`** (Pillar 4). A pending event blocks the
  tick (`debug_assert` in `tick.rs`); keep that invariant.
- No `mod.rs`, 800-line hard cap per file (everything is currently well under),
  no `_`-prefixed dead code — the two intentionally-idle fields
  (`Game::_assets`, texture manifest) are wired through the toolkit loader
  instead.

## Build / verify loop

```powershell
cargo test
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
cargo fmt -- --check
.\scripts\capture_ui.ps1 -Scenes menu,gameplay,event   # visual check
.\publish.ps1                                           # full validation + deploy
```

Note: the repo-root `Cargo.toml` workspace glob requires every top-level dir to be
a crate or excluded; `dragons_den` (gdd-only) was added to the exclude list during
this setup. `stellar_legacy` is not yet a git repository — run `git init` + initial
commit before starting M2 work (every sibling game is its own repo).

## Known cosmetic nits (fine to fix opportunistically)

- ~~Meter color logic treats <35% as "critical" red — inverted for
  `cultural_drift`/`adaptation`~~ **FIXED (2026-07-18)** — `term_meter_toned`
  takes a `MeterTone` (`LowCritical`/`HighCritical`/`Neutral`); the dashboard
  bars tag adaptation `Neutral` and cultural drift `HighCritical`.
- ~~The event modal header band is empty~~ **FIXED (2026-07-18)** — the
  category/legacy line now renders centered in the header band; the title leads
  the body.
- Menu lists legacies in sorted-id order (Adaptors first); GDD implies no order,
  but Preservers-first might read better.
